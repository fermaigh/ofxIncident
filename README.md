Incident is a project that emphasizes on practicing focus and concentration skills by involving in play experiences. 
In this project, I am exploring a improved mind play interfacing and suggesting a future mind play mode by 
translating distracting into a challenge for the player to rethink of what concentration is and provide them a chance 
to learn to stay focused in a given environment.
