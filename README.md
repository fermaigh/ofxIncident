Incident is a project that emphasizes on practicing focus and concentration skills by involving in play experiences. 
In this project, I am exploring a improved mind play interfacing and suggesting a future mind play mode by 
translating distracting into a challenge for the player to rethink of what concentration is and provide them a chance 
to learn to stay focused in a given environment.

The mechanism is 
welcome screen 
attention >=63, game starts
attention <63, remain on welcome screen and the blur changes based on attention

Game starts
attention >= 30, game keeps going until the end
attention < 63 for <= 5 sec, game pauses with a alert message on it.
attention <63 for > 5 sec, game is over and automatically goes back to welcome screen
